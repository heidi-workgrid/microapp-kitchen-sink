## Workgrid Kitchen Sink Microapp

This is a basic example of a Microapp built for the [Workgrid](https://www.workgrid.com) platform. Microapps and by extension this repository are still in **BETA** so things may break or change at any time. Also the Microapp SDK is not public (yet). If you intend on building or running this Microapp yourself please contact your Customer Success Director and ask for the Microapp SDK.

Please note that Microapps are meant to be "micro"; similar to apps on your phone. They should be focused, small, and quick to interact with.

The primary purpose of this repository and Microapp is to allow you to quickly install a Microapp on your installation of the Workgrid Toolbar or mobile app to get a feel for how it works. It also is a reasonably good codebase to start with when you are building your own Microapp.

**Getting Started**

This is a "create-react-app" application and is not ejected so most of what you can do in the "create-react-app" you can do here. https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

1. Be sure to have npm or yarn installed
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` at the base of the project
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to startup the Microapp
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3002 to view the app

To run this within a local Workgrid Toolbar see the Development Kit: https://github.com/Workgrid/workgrid-development-kit

This Microapp won't work at all outside the toolbar. So either use the local Development Kit above or install it into your official toolbar (via the catalog).

**Support**

If you have issues with this repo please submit an issue and I'll see what I can do. If you have Microapp specific questions please contact your Customer Success Director.
